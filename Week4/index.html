    <p>Drew Hansen got his start in the tech world at a young age. He started in middle school with the Tandy TRS-80
        in the computer lab as a teacher's aid. His parents bought him a Commodore VIC-20 and 64 where he learned BASIC.
        He loved to write programs and even taught himself to make the computer play Christmas songs. After graduating
        high school and attending some college, he joined the Air Force and had a long career as an aircraft Loadmaster,
        flying all over the world.<br><br>
        After retirement, he went back to college as a Mathematics major until his old life called and offered him a 
        contracting job flying as a Loadmaster on C-130s, dropping fire retardant all over the western United States.
        Unfortunately, the US Forest Service decided to mothball the tanker program he was flying on and Drew had to 
        find a new line of work.<br><br>
        He attended a networking (Cisco) bootcamp where he learned the ins and outs of routers and switches and obtained
        many Cisco certifications. Much to his surprise, the bootcamp was shady and encouraged their attendees to falsify
        their networking experience in order to obtain employment they were not qualified for. Fortunately he was able to
        obtain honest work at the Air Force Base he lived near as a contractor in a rescue squadron.<br><br>
        While serving the Air Force as a contractor, Drew finally finished his degree and obtained a Bachelor of Science
        in Network Operations and Security from Western Governors University. Using his new degree, he applied and was 
        hired at Raytheon as an IT specialist, working in and maintaining a classifed computer network. His time at Raytheon 
        was fairly short, and he took his talents to the US Army as a Senior Network administrator, maintaining the Army's 
        Global Enterprise Fabric utilizing the command line to keep switches in specification and ensuring no downtime for 
        end users. <br><br>
        Tired of commuting 120 miles a day in an economy where fuel prices were skyrocketing, he came back to the Air Force 
        Base near his home as an IT specialist again in a fighter squadron. He was responsible for a small classified network 
        and ensuring pilots had access to their mission planning materials. It was at this time when the Veterans Administration
        came out with the <a href="https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/vettec-high-tech-program/">
        VET-TEC</a> program. After learning about the <a href="https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/vettec-high-tech-program/">
            VET-TEC</a> program he applied with the VA and was approved. He researched many of the boot camps and interviewd with a 
        few of them. <a href="https://savvycoders.com/">SavvyCoders</a> appealed to Drew immediately, due to their job placement
        statistics and program structure. Drew is currently in the March cohort and is on track to be a Full Stack Web Developer
        by June with certifications/skills in the following:</p>
